# Vector Calculus Crate
A Rust crate to simplify working with vector calculus, designed to be
as easy to write and work with as possible, to mimic a high-level feel
but low-level Rust features.
## Version Control
- v0.0 - Initial commit: Vectors and Scalar Functions
- v0.01 - Added Vector Functions, as well as curl, div, gradient, etc.
